    <h3>Description</h3>
      <p> “Francese and piccata are very similar. The difference between the two is for Francese, the chicken breast is first dipped in flour then into a beaten egg mixture, before being cooked. For piccata, the chicken is first dipped in egg and then in flour. Both are simmered in a lemony butter sauce, but the piccata sauce includes capers.”
